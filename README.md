# Flights-prices-tracker

## Project abandoned for now


## Objective

To make a well-rounded search engine, where a user can filter flights based on preferences and get notifications for new  flights with similar preferences.


## To-do list

1. Research the Skyscanner API
   * Time between requests
   * Can data of entire population be scraped
   * What type of data I can obtain
2. Build barebones model
   * Make it work for just one user
   * Make it work with real-life data
3. Notification system
   * Send emails using SMTP library
4. Ease the choice of preferences
   * Simple function for user to decide preferences
   
## Learning objectives

I'm hoping to learn more about use of API's and how to parse real time data. As well as improving my Python development skills.
